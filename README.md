This repository contains the material and outputs from the Deep Learning with NLP Crash Course I took as an initial step into the giant worlds of both DL and NLP. The course is one of [Machine Learning Mastery](https://machinelearningmastery.com/) courses by **Jason Brownlee**, and it can be found [here](https://machinelearningmastery.com/crash-course-deep-learning-natural-language-processing/). The course focuses on Sentimant Analysis with Convolutional Nueral Netwok.

The course has 7 lessons, and a task for each lesson. However, I did not follow the tasks as they were but took the opportunity to try out additional related practices.
More specifically, I combined the tasks of lessons 5 and 7 into several exercises of my own, as extensions to lesson 5, while working on MDBI review dataset imported from Keras. For further learning and code example, I also used this [samyzaf tutorial](http://www.samyzaf.com/ML/imdb/imdb.html).

Spcifically, the lesson 5 extensions are:
- Use of pre-train enbedding
- Use of grid search and randomized search
- Multiple kernel size (multi channel model)
- Multiple kernel size with randomized search
- Two convolution layers
